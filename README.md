# FileCrypt

FileCrypt is a GUI-based application for encrypting and decrypting files using Python's `tkinter` for the user interface and `cryptography` for secure encryption. This tool makes it easy to securely encrypt sensitive files and later decrypt them using a secret key.

## Features

- **File Encryption**: Encrypt any file and securely save it alongside a generated secret key.
- **File Decryption**: Decrypt encrypted files using the saved secret key.
- **Simple GUI**: User-friendly interface with separate options for encryption and decryption.
- **Help Section**: Detailed instructions to guide users through encryption and decryption.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install the `cryptography` and `tkinter` library:
```bash
pip install cryptography
pip install tkinter
